I'm always looking for ways to write better code, faster.  A great way to do that is lean on your fellow developers and pick their brain.  But your colleagues can only field so many questions and aren't always at your beck and call.  So what are the specific things you can do to improve?

A combination of reading and writing code is probably the most effective way to improve yourself.  Read a book, ebook, blog post, or questions and answers on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).  Attend a code camp, hackathon, conference, or confer with your [DKG]((/2012/07/20/establish-your-own-developer-kaizen-guild/)).  We live in a truly amazing time, especially as developers.  We often take for granted the amount of code that is available from the awesome individuals who contribute to open source projects on GitHub and other code hosting sites.  We use it everyday to get stuff done, but why not view the source and learn from it?  [Teach a man to fish](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2279.html), right?

[GitHub](http://GitHub.com) is probably the single most valuable resource for developers these days.
