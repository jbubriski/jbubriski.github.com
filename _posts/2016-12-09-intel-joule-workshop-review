So I somehow got invited to an Intel Joule™ Workshop!

*Disclaimer: The event was free, food/drink was provided, and I was given little Leatherman tool as a gift.  However I wasn't asked to do this review.*

TLDR: The Intel Joule™ Compute Module is a tiny computer with a lot of horsepower.  It's goal is to be very developer friendly and cost-effective for the amount of horsepower you get.  The event was pretty good, but they have some kinks to work out (which I'm sure they will).

## Schedule

The event consisted of general powerpoint presentations, Q&A, and general hardware setup/configuration in the morning.  The second half of the day was spent trying out various demo projects.

There were some issues with getting going in the morning since there were issues with the WIFI not being ready, and one of the installers was downloading large files which quickly saturated the available bandwidth (There were like 50 people).  I also had issues getting the Intel System Studio fully installed.  However, I was able to use the Intel XDK just fine, and that is what the rest of the examples used anyway.

This was the first Joule workshop they've done so there were some rough edges.  Mainly, presentations were a bit dry, although the presenter (Grace) was super knowledgable about the platform.  There were also 3 Intel Developer Evangelists (who don't work for Intel) onsite helping out with issues and answering any questions.  Some of my hardware had crazily bent pins, but I was able to bend them back without issue.  There was also a missing bracket to hold the fan over the Joule's heatsink, but they acknowledged that and it wasn't a big deal.

## Developer board

## Intel RealSense Camera R200

We got to use the Intel RealSense Camera R200 with the Joule.

- 1080p 
- 3 cameras providing RGB (color) and stereoscopic IR to produce depth
- Inside range of 0.5m to 2.5m
- Outside range up to 10m

## Robotics Shield

## Arduino 101






## Conclusion

TBH, the market penetration isn’t there for these devices so it wouldn’t be practical to build apps/games solely dependent on the hand/face tracking.  However, you may be able to guarantee the presence of the device in certain industries (medical, gov?), or you could offer an enhanced/alternate modes for when the camera is present.  It sounds like these cameras will eventually end up in most PC laptops, but it is probably going to be a while for you to *expect* people to have one (just like what happened with the original web cam).

Developing for this type of device shouldn't be forced.  To paraphrase the Intel guy, you should use  interfaces to do what they're designed to do.  Don’t create a virtual keyboard when you know that this will be attached to a laptop/desktop that already has a mouse/keyboard.  So unfortunately, having these other great specialized input mechanisms almost limits the applications of the hand/face tracking.  But that's a good thing too.

I think games will be where this might initially take off, as well as private applications with integrated hardware.  I'm hoping that someday we all have enhanced versions of these camera so we can practice Karate, sign language, dancing, and more.
