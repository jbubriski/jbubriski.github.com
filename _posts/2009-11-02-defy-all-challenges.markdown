Microsoft's Marketing is a bit strange at times, as seen in this video:



But overall, I think they usually have the right message, however obscured it may be.

Personally, I love their slogan for Visual Studio:


> Defy All Challenges


And really, that is what being a programmer is all about!  We face challenges of all magnitudes every single day.  If you didn't like challenges, you probably wouldn't have chosen your current profession, or at least you wouldn't like it!

As much as we may wish for easy days, challenges are what make our jobs interesting.
