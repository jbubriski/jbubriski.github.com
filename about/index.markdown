I'm a well rounded full-stack developer currently specializing in C#, JavaScript and ASP.NET MVC. I'm also fluent in PHP and I dabble in other languages such as Python and Ruby.


## Current employment and activites

I'm currently a Web Developer at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)!

I also build indie games at [Frag Castle Games](http://fragcastle.com) with [Jared Barboza](http://codeimpossible.com).  We have an upcoming title currently undergoing development.


## Programming languages

In order of proficiency:

- C#
- JavaScript (Raw, Canvas, jQuery)
- HTML / CSS
- VB.NET
- PHP
- SQL (SQL Server and MySQL mostly)
- Python and Ruby - Nothing production worthy, but I've writtena few scripts here and there.

## Accomplishments

I was a speaker at the 2012 [MonkeySpace conference](http://monkeyspace.org/) in Boston, MA. [Jared Barboza](http://codeimpossible.com) and I spoke about Micro-ORM's. [Link to the video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/56814733).

## Frameworks/Tech/Skills

- ASP.NET MVC!  Didn't use v1 much, but v2 was pretty good and v3 and v4 are even better!  I love the whole philosophy of MVC, and how clean it can be.  No more ViewState! IOC and DI FTW!
- Entity Framework - I've done multiple projects using EF and have come to like it.  EF 4 and code first are a decent solution!  However, I've come to prefer...
- [Massive](https://github.com/robconery/massive/) - A fun "Micro ORM" started by [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/helpy-stuff/and-i-shall-call-it-massive) that utilizes the C# 4.0 dynamic keyword.
- [Dapper](http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/) - The same "Micro ORM" used by [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
- LINQ - LINQ is great and I can't imagine writing code without it.  I've used most aspects of LINQ and consider myself an expert.  I've also used LINQ to SQL on a couple projects, although not since Microsoft decided to stop adding features to it..
- .NET CMS': Kentico, Sitecore, Sitefinty, and (unfortunately) Ektron.
- PHP CMS': I've worked with WordPress a little and have used it extensively.  I've touched Drupal and Joomla a little bit, but my hand was sticky afterwards...
- .NET controls and libraries: iTextSharp, Telerik RAD controls, and some other PDF libraries.
- Web Services: Done a lot of random stuff with different web service technologies like WCF, ASP.NET Web API and REST.
