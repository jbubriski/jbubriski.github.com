I'm a well rounded developer currently working on ASP.NET web applications. My weapon (language) of choice is C#, but I'm also fluent in PHP and have a pretty wide breadth of knowledge (I try to anyway).

I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Worcester Envelope Company](http://www.worcesterenvelope.com/) where I work on internal business applications.

Previously I was a Senior Software Developer at [Wakefly](http://www.wakefly.com) in Westborough, MA. I install, configure, and develop functionality for various CMS's like Kentico. **I'm also a certified developer and trainer for [Kentico](http://www.kentico.com)**! I've also worked with other CMS's like Sitecore, Sitefinty, DotNetNuke, Ektron, Drupal, Joomla.

Previously I was employed at The Soma Group in Westborough, MA where I worked in both CRM and Life Sciences.  I acted as a member of the professional services team for RightNow technologies implementing various customizations and extensions to their PHP based hosted CRM application.  I also developed Life Sciences applications for multiple customers using C# and Winforms.

Here are some of the technologies I've worked with:

- ASP.NET MVC!  Didn't use v1.0 much, but v2.0 was pretty good and v3.0 is even better!  I love the whole philosophy of MVC, and how clean it can be.  No more ViewState! IOC and DI FTW!
- Entity Framework -I've done multiple projects using EF and have come to like it.  Psyched that EF 4 is here!
- [Massive](https://github.com/robconery/massive/) - A fun "Micro ORM" started by [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/helpy-stuff/and-i-shall-call-it-massive) that utilizes the C# 4.0 dynamic keyword.
- Dapper - The same "Micro ORM" used by [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
- LINQ - LINQ is great and I can't imagine writing code without it.  I've used most aspects of LINQ and consider myself an expert.  I've also used LINQ to SQL on a couple projects, although not since Microsoft decided to stop adding features to it..
- .NET CMS': Kentico, Sitecore, Sitefinty, and (unfortunately) Ektron.
- PHP CMS': I've touched Drupal and Joomla a little bit, but my hand was sticky afterwards...
- .NET controls and libraries: iTextSharp, Telerik RAD controls, and some other PDF libraries.
- Web Services: Done a lot of random stuff with different web service technologies.
- SQL - I've written more SQL than I'd like :P  Mostly for SQL Server and MySQL, but I wrote a little for Oracle too.
- JavaScript - I was writing JavaScript before jQuery, but I never liked it :P  Now JavaScript is fun again.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XHTML, XML, XSD - I can work with HTML and CSS fairly well, but I have NO design talent! But I could probably reproduce a Photoshop mockup with markup, and can edit images fairly well.
