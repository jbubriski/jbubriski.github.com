        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a husband, father, and programmer. I generally develop web applications with
            C# and ASP.NET MVC, but I love learning new things. I've messed around with a Netduino
            Plus and some other Microcontroller programming. In a past professional life I was
            a PHP programmer. I've also dabbled in Python and Ruby. I haven't found my ideal
            job yet, but I'm not sure I even know what that is. I think I will ultimately want
            to be a programming teacher, but for now I want to make some money :)</p>
        <p>
            It's a great feeling when I'm training (teaching) someone and you see the lightbulb
            turn on. Until I retire as a teacher, I want to learn as much as possible, learning
            new languages, patterns, styles, techniques, methods, and anything else that will
            help me ship better software. I once had dreams of being a game programmer, but
            I don't think that lifestyle is for me (and my family).
