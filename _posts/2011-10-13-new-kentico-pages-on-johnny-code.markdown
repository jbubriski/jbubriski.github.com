I just wanted to let you know that I have 2 new pages on the site!

There is a new [Kentico Resources](/kentico-resources/) page that contains a short list of some important resources.  Feel free to let me know about any others

Also, there is a new [Kentico Tips and Tricks](/kentico-resources/kentico-tips-and-tricks/index.html) page that contains... you guessed it!  Tips and Tricks!  Really, it's just a place I'm going to start putting some of the API calls and other information that is hard to find.
