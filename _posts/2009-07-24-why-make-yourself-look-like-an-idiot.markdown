I can't take it anymore!

Why do people post **_bad_** profile pictures for their blogs and articles!!!  I know a person's appearance have nothing to do with their abilities, but come on!  They're not even trying!

Why post some random picture of yourself looking angry, or in the middle of doing something, or with your face 2 inches from your web cam.  Do programmers ever smile!?

So actually, it does make me think less of them because they're not smart enough to take a half-decent picture!

Here are some examples:
